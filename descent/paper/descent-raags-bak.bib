This also suggests using monads directly, and our monadic approach to Galois descent makes no reference to Grothendieck descent theory at all. In order to make Galois descent constructions perfectly clear, we also describe their connections with some other related constructions of categorical algebra, and make various explicit calculations, especially with 1-cocycles and 1-dimensional non-abelian cohomology, usually omitted in the literature.},

Thus, given a data measurement \textmu{} : 1 \textrightarrow{} D, a posterior probability PH = I {$\smwhtcircle$} \textmu{} can be computed. This procedure is iterative: with each updated probability PH , we obtain a new joint distribution which in turn yields a new inference map I and the process repeats with each additional measurement. The main result uses an existence theorem for regular conditional probabilities by Faden, which holds in more generality than the setting of Polish spaces. This less stringent setting then allows for non-trivial decision rules (Eilenberg\textendash Moore algebras) on finite (as well as non finite) spaces, and also provides for a common framework for decision theory and Bayesian probability.},

We prove that a sequence of simplicial graphs [Formula: see text] forms a family of expander graphs if and only if a certain natural mini-max invariant arising from the cup product in the cohomology rings of the groups [Formula: see text] agrees with the Cheeger constant of the sequence of graphs, thus allowing us to characterize expander graphs via cohomology. This result is proved in the more general framework of vector space expanders, a novel structure consisting of sequences of vector spaces equipped with vector-space-valued bilinear pairings which satisfy a certain mini-max condition. These objects can be considered to be analogues of expander graphs in the realm of linear algebra, with a dictionary being given by the cup product in cohomology, and in this context represent a different approach to expanders that those developed by Lubotzky\textendash Zelmanov and Bourgain\textendash Yehudayoff.},

  urldate = {2023-08-07},
  abstract = {In the 1970's Baudisch introduced the idea of the semifree group, that is, a group in which the only relators are commutators of generators. Baudisch was mainly concerned with subgroup problems, employing length arguments on the elements of these groups. More recently Droms and Servatius have continued the study of semifree, or graph groups, as they call them. They answer some of the questions left open by the work of Baudisch. It is possible to take the graph analogy a level higher and study graph products of groups, which not only generalise graph groups, but also free and direct products. In this thesis we seek to explore the properties of graph products of groups. After some preliminaries in chapter 1, chapter 2 quotes the main results from the work of Baudisch, Droms and Servatius on graph groups, and includes a few elementary results. In chapter 3 we show that many of the well known results about free products and direct products will generalise to graph products. We also extend some of the results on graph groups and give a counter example to a plausible conjecture. We develop a normal form for elements in graph products and, with the use of a generalised free product representation, show solvability of the word and conjugacy problems. In-chapter 4 we examine the concept of graphological indecomposability. Having disposed of an obvious conjecture by way of a counter example we present a number of isomorphism theorems. Chapter 5 is devoted to residual properties of graph products. Much work has been done by Stebe, Allenby and others on residual finiteness, conjugacy separability and potency of free groups and free products. We generalise some of these results. Finally, in chapter 6 we return to graph groups for a look at the Freiheitssatz. Various subclasses have been covered by Pride, Baumslag and Howie, and we seek to extend their results.},

We show that special cube-complexes virtually admit local isometries to the standard 2-complexes of naturally associated right-angled Artin groups. Consequently, special cube-complexes have linear fundamental groups. In the word-hyperbolic case, we prove the separability of quasiconvex subgroups of fundamental groups of special cube-complexes. Finally, we give a linear variant of Rips's short exact sequence.},

  abstract = {In this article we study the right-angled Artin subgroups of a given right-angled Artin group. Starting with a graph \$\textbackslash gam\$, we produce a new graph through a purely combinatorial procedure, and call it the extension graph \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$ of \$\textbackslash gam\$. We produce a second graph \$\textbackslash gam\^e\_k\$, the clique graph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$, by adding extra vertices for each complete subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$. We prove that each finite induced subgraph \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$ gives rise to an inclusion \$A(\textbackslash Lambda)\textbackslash to A(\textbackslash gam)\$. Conversely, we show that if there is an inclusion \$A(\textbackslash Lambda)\textbackslash to A(\textbackslash gam)\$ then \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ is an induced subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\_k\$. These results have a number of corollaries. Let \$P\_4\$ denote the path on four vertices and let \$C\_n\$ denote the cycle of length \$n\$. We prove that \$A(P\_4)\$ embeds in \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ if and only if \$P\_4\$ is an induced subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\$. We prove that if \$F\$ is any finite forest then \$A(F)\$ embeds in \$A(P\_4)\$. We recover the first author's result on co--contraction of graphs and prove that if \$\textbackslash gam\$ has no triangles and \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ contains a copy of \$A(C\_n)\$ for some \$n\textbackslash geq 5\$, then \$\textbackslash gam\$ contains a copy of \$C\_m\$ for some \$5\textbackslash le m\textbackslash le n\$. We also recover Kambites' Theorem, which asserts that if \$A(C\_4)\$ embeds in \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ then \$\textbackslash gam\$ contains an induced square. Finally, we determine precisely when there is an inclusion \$A(C\_m)\textbackslash to A(C\_n)\$ and show that there is no "universal" two--dimensional right-angled Artin group.},

From this result, we are able to develop a Nielsen\textendash Thurston classification for elements in the right-angled Artin group. Our analogy spans both the algebra regarding subgroups of right-angled Artin groups and mapping class groups, as well as the geometry of the extension graph and the curve graph. On the geometric side, we establish an analogue of Masur and Minsky's Bounded Geodesic Image Theorem and their distance formula.},

First, we establish some tools and terminology for dealing with computations using the cohomology of tree braid groups, couching our discussion in the language of differential forms. Second, we show that, given a tree braid group \$B\_nT\$ on \$n = 4\$ or 5 strands, \$H\^*(B\_nT)\$ is an exterior face algebra. Finally, we prove that one may reconstruct the tree \$T\$ from a tree braid group \$B\_nT\$ for \$n = 4\$ or 5. Among other corollaries, this third step shows that, when \$n = 4\$ or 5, tree braid groups \$B\_nT\$ and trees \$T\$ (up to homeomorphism) are in bijective correspondence. That such a bijection exists is not true for higher dimensional spaces, and is an artifact of the 1-dimensionality of trees. We end by stating the results for right-angled Artin groups corresponding to the main theorems, some of which do not yet appear in the literature.},
