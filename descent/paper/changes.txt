In addition to several small typos that were fixed 
(some pointed out by the referee, others caught in 
revision), here are the main changes:

1. On page 3, following the referee suggestion,
we replaced the vague "map" with the more 
precise "homomorphism", and clarified that 
this takes place in the class of all groups.

2. On page 6, following the referee suggestion,
we clarified that the functors in our adjunction 
are covariant.

3. On pages 9 and 10, following the referee suggestion,
we clarified the definition of coreflexive pair 
and added a quick definition of an equalizer.

4. On pages 11 and 12, following the referee suggestion, 
we clarified that the algorithm expects a finite presentation 
of a group, rather than a nebulous "isomorphism type".

5. On page 12, inspired by a referee remark, 
we added a sentence clarifying that we don't need to 
explicitly ask for G and H to be raags in the statement 
of theorem 2. Indeed, the existence of an AC-coalgebra structure
guarantees that a group is a raag, and we already require this 
in the theorem statement. Additionally we added a footnote 
saying that the coalgebra structure and the underlying graph 
contain exactly the same information, and we can recover one 
from the other.

5. On page 12, we removed a sentence flagged by the referee 
describing the coalgebra structure in case we know the 
underlying graph. This is actually the same information as 
presented in the last paragraph of section 2, so it wasn't 
worth keeping.

6. The most substantial change was the addition of a 
more difficult example, worked out in full, at the 
end of Section 5. The referee's suggestion to include 
this example was extremely helpful, and I think this 
new example does a much better job showing the utility 
of this machinery.
