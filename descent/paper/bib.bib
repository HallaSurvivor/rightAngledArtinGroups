Thus, given a data measurement \textmu{} : 1 \textrightarrow{} D, a posterior probability PH = I {$\smwhtcircle$} \textmu{} can be computed. This procedure is iterative: with each updated probability PH , we obtain a new joint distribution which in turn yields a new inference map I and the process repeats with each additional measurement. The main result uses an existence theorem for regular conditional probabilities by Faden, which holds in more generality than the setting of Polish spaces. This less stringent setting then allows for non-trivial decision rules (Eilenberg\textendash Moore algebras) on finite (as well as non finite) spaces, and also provides for a common framework for decision theory and Bayesian probability.},

In this note I will recap the basic Dialectica constructions and then go on to describe the less well-known interplay of comonads, coalgebras and comonoids that characterizes the composite functor standing for the ``of course!'' operator in dialectica categories. This composition of comonads evokes some work on stateful games by Laird and others, also discussed in the setting of Reddy's system LLMS (Linear Logic Model of State).},

We produce a second graph \$\textbackslash gam\^e\_k\$, the clique graph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$, by adding extra vertices for each complete subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$. We prove that each finite induced subgraph \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\$ gives rise to an inclusion \$A(\textbackslash Lambda)\textbackslash to A(\textbackslash gam)\$. Conversely, we show that if there is an inclusion \$A(\textbackslash Lambda)\textbackslash to A(\textbackslash gam)\$ then \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ is an induced subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\^e\_k\$. These results have a number of corollaries. Let \$P\_4\$ denote the path on four vertices and let \$C\_n\$ denote the cycle of length \$n\$. We prove that \$A(P\_4)\$ embeds in \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ if and only if \$P\_4\$ is an induced subgraph of \$\textbackslash gam\$. We prove that if \$F\$ is any finite forest then \$A(F)\$ embeds in \$A(P\_4)\$. We recover the first author's result on co--contraction of graphs and prove that if \$\textbackslash gam\$ has no triangles and \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ contains a copy of \$A(C\_n)\$ for some \$n\textbackslash geq 5\$, then \$\textbackslash gam\$ contains a copy of \$C\_m\$ for some \$5\textbackslash le m\textbackslash le n\$. We also recover Kambites' Theorem, which asserts that if \$A(C\_4)\$ embeds in \$A(\textbackslash gam)\$ then \$\textbackslash gam\$ contains an induced square. Finally, we determine precisely when there is an inclusion \$A(C\_m)\textbackslash to A(C\_n)\$ and show that there is no "universal" two--dimensional right-angled Artin group.},

From this result we are able to develop a Nielsen--Thurston classification for elements in the right-angled Artin group. Our analogy spans both the algebra regarding subgroups of right-angled Artin groups and mapping class groups, as well as the geometry of the extension graph and the curve graph. On the geometric side, we establish an analogue of Masur and Minsky's Bounded Geodesic Image Theorem and their distance formula.},

In this paper we prove that for all sufficiently large \$N\$, the mapping classes \$\textbackslash\{f\_1\^N,...,f\_k\^N\textbackslash\}\$ generate a right-angled Artin group. The right-angled Artin group which they generate can be determined from the combinatorial topology of the mapping classes themselves. When \$\textbackslash\{f\_1,...,f\_k\textbackslash\}\$ are arbitrary mapping classes, we show that sufficiently large powers of these mapping classes generate a group which embeds in a right-angled Artin group in a controlled way. We establish some analogous results for real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. We also discuss the unsolvability of the isomorphism problem for finitely generated subgroups of \$\textbackslash Mod\_\{g,p\}\$, and prove that the isomorphism problem for right-angled Artin groups is solvable. We thus characterize the isomorphism type of many naturally occurring subgroups of \$\textbackslash Mod\_\{g,p\}\$.},

We clarify the sense in which codensity monads act as substitutes for monads induced by adjunctions. We also expand on an undeservedly ignored theorem of Kennison and Gildenhuys: that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite sets) into (sets) is the ultrafilter monad. This result is analogous to the correspondence between measures and integrals. So, for example, we can speak of integration against an ultrafilter. Using this language, we show that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is double dualization. From this it follows that compact Hausdorff spaces have a linear analogue: linearly compact vector spaces. Finally, we show that ultraproducts are categorically inevitable: the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite families of sets) into (families of sets) is the ultraproduct monad.},

We also show that the rational subset membership problem is decidable for a graph group if and only if the independence graph is a transitive forest, answering a question of Kambites, Silva, and the second author [24]. Finally we prove that for certain amalgamated free products and HNN-extensions the rational subset and submonoid membership problems are recursively equivalent. In particular, this applies to finitely generated groups with two or more ends that are either torsion-free or residually finite.},

Second, we show that, given a tree braid group \$B\_nT\$ on \$n = 4\$ or 5 strands, \$H\^*(B\_nT)\$ is an exterior face algebra. Finally, we prove that one may reconstruct the tree \$T\$ from a tree braid group \$B\_nT\$ for \$n = 4\$ or 5.

That such a bijection exists is not true for higher dimensional spaces, and is an artifact of the 1-dimensionality of trees.
