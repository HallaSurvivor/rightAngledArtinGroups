They have a rich structure of subgroups and nice algorithmic properties, and they give rise to cubical complexes with a variety of applications. This survey article is meant to introduce readers to these groups and to give an overview of the relevant literature.},

	title = {Right-angled {Artin} groups and a generalized isomorphism problem for finitely generated subgroups of mapping class groups},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1118},
	abstract = {Consider the mapping class group \${\textbackslash}Mod\_\{g,p\}\$ of a surface \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{g,p\}\$ of genus \$g\$ with \$p\$ punctures, and a finite collection \${\textbackslash}\{f\_1,...,f\_k{\textbackslash}\}\$ of mapping classes, each of which is either a Dehn twist about a simple closed curve or a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism supported on a connected subsurface. In this paper we prove that for all sufficiently large \$N\$, the mapping classes \${\textbackslash}\{f\_1{\textasciicircum}N,...,f\_k{\textasciicircum}N{\textbackslash}\}\$ generate a right-angled Artin group. The right-angled Artin group which they generate can be determined from the combinatorial topology of the mapping classes themselves. When \${\textbackslash}\{f\_1,...,f\_k{\textbackslash}\}\$ are arbitrary mapping classes, we show that sufficiently large powers of these mapping classes generate a group which embeds in a right-angled Artin group in a controlled way. We establish some analogous results for real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. We also discuss the unsolvability of the isomorphism problem for finitely generated subgroups of \${\textbackslash}Mod\_\{g,p\}\$, and prove that the isomorphism problem for right-angled Artin groups is solvable. We thus characterize the isomorphism type of many naturally occurring subgroups of \${\textbackslash}Mod\_\{g,p\}\$.},

	abstract = {We develop an analogy between right-angled Artin groups and mapping class groups through the geometry of their actions on the extension graph and the curve graph respectively. The central result in this paper is the fact that each right-angled Artin group acts acylindrically on its extension graph. From this result we are able to develop a Nielsen--Thurston classification for elements in the right-angled Artin group. Our analogy spans both the algebra regarding subgroups of right-angled Artin groups and mapping class groups, as well as the geometry of the extension graph and the curve graph. On the geometric side, we establish an analogue of Masur and Minsky's Bounded Geodesic Image Theorem and their distance formula.},
